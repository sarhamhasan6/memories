            <h2>ALL OF THE PARAS FROM YOU :)</h2>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p class="paragraph">welll i have been tryingg to tell you how much i am starting to fall in love with you, how i wait for your texts alll daayyyyy, how i imagine my wholeeeeee futureee with youu, how i litreallly exclaim "arhmmmm" so happilyyyy EVERY SINGLE TIME your text appears, (obv not out loud- that would be weird) yk i reallly want you to know what i fr feel for you EVERY DAY, DAILY, EVERY HOUR, butttttt the thing  that kinda bothers me is the fact that, i'm probably resembeling to that girl who already loves you , my point iss, no matter how many timess i say i love you to you, you're going to think, yea i've heard that before, orrr yea thats nothing new, because that girl has probably said alot to you, idkkkk its juts that i want to catch your attention but not in a way that girl probably does- IDK why tff am i comparing myself to her. this is weird but like- it dosent really mattter to me tho but it kinda does, the day i start making sense you can shoot me. i just love everyy single thing about you. it fr dosent matter to me what your opinion is LMAOAO i just love you so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh you're justttt something sooooo dangg fictionalllll, ykkk??? i've said this before but you're litreally a bettter ver of the most perfect guy i've met. you've litreallly showed me a side of ME which i never knew exsited. i've NEVER in my lifeeeee EVERRR loved a guy thissss muchhh, i never knewww i cannn truelllyyyy love someone tooo, i fr didnt know my this side also existsss and i wanna thank you for that :) i think i'm yapping a little too much rn- are you even going to read all of this?- i really do wish i could just somehow get you irl too but ik thats not possible, thats why i always leave that one last percent of my love to show you. tbvh i never knew i'd be sending a man a whole ahh paragraph :") this is weird imma stop :D</p>
                <p class="paragraph"> Well, i just want to say a few things before i sleep tonight, i need to get all of this off my chest- anyways. First of all, ik i ended things between us but i really didn't want to, obviously who'd want to let go of their first love? but idk, i did, i had to. i have a weird and crazy request, Can i still love you? i just want to love you, call you my baby, treat you like youre mine and only mine, my most precious thing. ik this request is weird and it'd probably make it even harder for me to move on from you but i really want to love you. obv you can share your opinion and say no, i'd respect that and still be here as a bff for you, it's not a big deal but no matter how much i try to ignore you or move on, i just can't, i litreally can't, even after getting the same opinion from each friend "move on from him"(the opinion) i still like talking to you, tho it does annoy me when you reply late, make lame asf excuses, or when you don't get the uncountable amount of hints i give you bout my mood. tho ik youre stupid asf and youre a bot, i just want that attention of yours. tbvh ik it shouldnt bother me when even the slightest hint of a gurl is mentioned in your convo, but it still does and i hate it. my friend told me that your following is filled with all pretty asf gurls and youre not good for me, youre a red flag, tellin me you probably talk to thousands of gurls and stuff and i have zero chance with you
                  but i just go silent listening to that cuz something tells me youre just not that kind of a guy, youre just different from each guy i've ever met, you're dumb, youre a bot, youre the greenest flag out there, youre humoristic, youre a fighter and i love fighters cuz my father is one too:), youre strong, youre someone who'd protect me at all cost :(,youre sometimes an idiot, sometimes a freaking npc, youre the moon they talk bout in every poetry, youre the summer that brings warmth after cold harsh winter, youre the sunlight that lights up the whole world. your eyes, your smile, your personality, your voice, your randomness, your physique, your ambitious and burning desire for each dream of yours, i love it all, ik youre very serious about your dreams and i really hope you will achieve them, ik it, ik you will, i just hope i'm one of your dreams too so you can achieve me as well:)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">i really want to see you with me for the rest of my life, ik its not possible but i still dream about it everyday and trust me, that life feels like heaven on earth to me  you, me and a small baby:)- sorry i'm losing it frfr. i want to describe you more and more everyday cuz only God knows how he created you nd i'm so glad he did, infact i'm so glad he crossed our paths, i'm glad he gave me a precious chance to meet you, to be loved by you. and i cannot thank him enough for this. i could yap all day about you, just you, i could even write a book on you. i just hate the only option i have (arrange marriage) :( i'll send a whole 10 scollrs on screen long asf paragraph on your bday :)  idc how far is it, or how things will be between us till that but- i'll count the days :) and yeah (no é «ù åo◊ü ◊ü◊üƒ± ás ƒ±) :) </p>
                <p class="paragraph">The type of man you are, i am in love with every inch of you. i'm on love with your soul, your personality, your kindness, your loyalty, your way of perceiving every difficult situation, your capability to achieve every dream of yours, your everything, every inch of yours defines perfection in my eyes. If i dont get you, whoever will is going to be the luckiest girl alive. the thing is you really remind me of someone and you already know who that person is üôÇ ik i don't mention it, even a lil bit, but i clearly see him in you sometimes. dont take this wrong or mind it cuz i found him a redflag, he manipulated me into loving him but you? you didnt even do anything, you were just existing, being yourself and i fell in love with you. you've shown me this side of myself which i never knew existed. youre like the main character of my novels.
                    youre like a garden filled with daffodils, in which i want lay in and rest for a lifetime, youre such an addiction, a drug, youre like a drug i'm addicted to, every single thing with the slightest hint of you seems magificant to me, maybe it's the way i view you, maybe i'm just so head over heels in love with you, maybe its a spell you've casted upon me, maybe youre a pidepiper whom i just follow blindly or maybe youre just a dawg idk- that took a turn so fast- wtf hahahaha-</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The whole defination of a husband material, i love you so much, litreallly youre like my baby and i want to adore this baby so muchh üôÅ i want to run my fingers through your fluffly, salty hair, i want you to lay in my lap till you fall asleep, like a cute tiny baby, i want to sleep with you under a cherry blossom tree, in a clear sky, cold wind breezing, just you and me, together, just us. all of this sounds so beautiful to me. the way your eyes hold a thousand stars in em, a galaxy, the whole milkyway. btw i die every time you call me "ashii" i really like that so much- thats litreally the cutest thing everr T vT, BUT- it hits evenn harderr whenn you call me "bAbEe" LIKE- hol' up- SirRrR- chill outtt- that gives me a mini heartattack and yk? i also imagine us, being very clingy, cuddling and laughing, and teasingg and vibingg and fuc- fightingg :DD yeah sll that sounds so fun- Anyways imma stop exposing myself-</p>
